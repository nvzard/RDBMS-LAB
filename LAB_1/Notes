Aim: SQL OVERVIEW/INTRODUCTION

DDL :- Data Definition Language(Used to define the database)(Changes the schema)
        Eg: CREATE, ALTER, DROP

DML :- Data Manipulation Language
		Eg: INSERT INTO, DELETE, UPDATE

DCL :- Data Control Language
		Eg: GRANT: Give priv to user
			REVOKE: Take back priv granted from the user

DQL :- Data Query Language
		Eg: SELECT, DESC, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
		Eg: SELECT * FROM [TABLE_NAME] WHERE [CONDITION]


SQL CONSTANT :- 
	KEY: Key is an attribute or group of attributes which can uniquely identify a tuple. 

for Relational DBMS:- No two tuples in a relation should be same. OR There should be a set
						of attributes in relation R such that all tuples of R can be differentiated with the help of that attribute.

Simple Key:- Key with single attribute.
Compound Key:- Key with two or more attrubutes.

Prime/Key attribute:-	Set of attribute that belongs to any key.

Non Prime/Key Attribute:- Set of attrubutes not belonging to any key.

Super Key:- Set of attributes used to differentiate tuple of the relation

Key- Minimum no of attributes used to differentiate all the tuples of the relation.(non null 		 tuples)
Candidate Key:- The minimal super key is known as candidate key

Primary Key;- 1.) Atmost '1' primary key per table.
			  2.) Not NULL
			  3.) Const - 'PRIMARY KEY'

Secondary/Alternate Key:- 1.) More than '1' alternate key is possible
						  2.) It can be null, but primary key banana hee padega.
						  3.) Const - 'UNIQUE'	

NULL:- 		1.)	No two NULL values are equal.
	   		2.)	All NULL are non zero.
	   		3.)	DBMS assign random ASCII value to every NULL such that no two NULLs are equal.

TYPES OF NULL:- 1.) Unknown:- DOB
	   			2.) Unexisting:- FAX_NO

CONSTANTS:- Rules enforced on the data column on the table. They are used to limit the type of
			data that can go   			This ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.

			TYPES:-
					1.) Column Level:- Applied to column
					2.) Table Level :- Applied to whole table

			Eg:- 1.) NOT NULL:- Ensures column has no NULL values
				 2.) DEFAULT:- It specifies a default value for column where none is specified.
				 3.) UNIQUE:- It ensures that all value in the column are different.
				 4.) PRIMARY KEY:- Uniquely identify each row in a column.
				 5.) FOREIGN KEY:- Uniquely identify a row record in another database table.
				 6.) CHECK:- It ensure certain checks, like range of a value
				 7.) INDEX:- Used to create and retrieve data very quickly.


SQL DATA TYPES:- 


SQL OPERATORS:- 
				1.) ARITHMATIC OPERATORS
				2.) COMPARISION OPERATOR
				3.) LOGICAL OPERATORS:- OR, AND, NOT, ANY, BETWEEN, EXISTS, IN, IS NULL, UNIQUE
